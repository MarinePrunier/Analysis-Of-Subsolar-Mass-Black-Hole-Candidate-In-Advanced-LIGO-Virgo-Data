# Analysis-Of-Subsolar-Mass-Black-Hole-Candidate-In-Advanced-LIGO-Virgo-Data
Complete Bayesian parameter estimation of a gravitational wave candidate event in LIGO-Virgo O3b data using BILBY PIPE. 

## Abstract 

A follow-up of one subsolar black hole candidate identified in the second part of the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration is carried out. With a search signal-to-noise ratio of $8.90$ and a false-alarm rate of 1 per 5 years, close the usual thresholds for claiming a gravitational-wave event, we can not exclude a noise origin. A complete Bayesian parameter estimation of this candidate, denoted SSM200308, reveals that if the signal originates from a compact binary coalescence, the component masses are $m_1= 0.62 {+0.46}_{- 0.20} M_{\odot}$ and $m_2 = 0.27{+0.12}_{-0.10} M_{\odot}$ (90\% credible interval) with at least one component being firmly subsolar, below the minimum mass of a neutron star.  This discards the hypothesis that the signal comes from a standard binary neutron star. The signal coherence test between the two LIGO detectors bring support to a compact object coalescence origin.
